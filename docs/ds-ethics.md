# Responsible AI

Microsoft has listed five Responsible AI principles:

- Fairness and inclusiveness: Models should treat everyone fairly and avoid different treatment for similar groups.
- Reliability and safety: Models should be reliable, safe, and consistent. You want a model to operate as intended,
  handle unexpected situations well, and resist harmful manipulation.
- Privacy and security: Be transparent about data collection, use, and storage, to empower individuals with control over
  their data. Treat data with care to ensure an individual's privacy.
- Transparency: When models influence important decisions that affect people's lives, people need to understand how
  those decisions were made and how the model works.
- Accountability: Take accountability for decisions that models may influence and maintain human control.
